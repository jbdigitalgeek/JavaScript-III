/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - Occurs essentially when `this` is called without a direct reference.

* 2. Implicit Binding - Is more specifc in that obj.this referring directly to the object rather than a general or no reference (Window).

* 3. Explicit Binding - Overwrites  previous `this` and is called using .apply or .call, they use information differently but both of those subtypes can work with multiple values.

* 4. New Binding - the `new` keyword creates a new ojbect and applies the new `this` values.

*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
